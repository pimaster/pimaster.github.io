				<h2>Software Projects</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://pimaster.github.io/decky/#{%22c2%22:%2200D304xf01mo%22}">Decky</a> - An online Magic the Gathering Deck viewer

					</li>
					<li>MTG Draft AI. When MTG Arena was having issues with Bot drafting, I thought that a self correcting AI draft bot should do better. I wrote a front and back end to test the theory and got promising results. Hosted the backend on DigitalOcean for a few months but ran into problems trying to gain enough training data. Was hoping for 1000's by asking friends to participate but only got to 100 or so. Poor Bot performance at the beginning turned help away. Would love to have it still functioning but it was a little too demanding for a raspberry pi.</li>
